# DisableTracking Plugin

## Description

In some cases it's pretty handy to disable tracking for selected websites of your Matomo instance, even for a short
timespan or forever. Working this way you can keep the collected data for later reporting.

This plugin is for free, feel free to spend me a coffe and send me your feedback. Further information you can find in
Matomo marketplace.
